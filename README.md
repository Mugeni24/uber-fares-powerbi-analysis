### 2. 🧬 Data Purification
- **Cleansing**: Removed null values and outliers in fare and distance fields to ensure data integrity.  
- **Transformation**: Standardized timestamps into datetime formats for seamless temporal analysis.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
uber_df = pd.read_csv('uber_fares.csv')

# Drop missing values
uber_df_clean = uber_df.dropna()

# Filter out invalid fares
uber_df_clean = uber_df_clean[uber_df_clean['fare_amount'] > 0]

# Restrict passenger counts to realistic range (1-6)
uber_df_clean = uber_df_clean[(uber_df_clean['passenger_count'] >= 1) & (uber_df_clean['passenger_count'] <= 6)]

# Define NYC geographic bounds
lon_min, lon_max = -74.05, -73.75
lat_min, lat_max = 40.63, 40.85

# Filter valid pickup and dropoff coordinates
uber_df_clean = uber_df_clean[
    (uber_df_clean['pickup_longitude'].between(lon_min, lon_max)) &
    (uber_df_clean['pickup_latitude'].between(lat_min, lat_max)) &
    (uber_df_clean['dropoff_longitude'].between(lon_min, lon_max)) &
    (uber_df_clean['dropoff_latitude'].between(lat_min, lat_max))
]

# Convert pickup_datetime to datetime
uber_df_clean['pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(uber_df_clean['pickup_datetime'], errors='coerce')
uber_df_clean = uber_df_clean.dropna(subset=['pickup_datetime'])

# Drop irrelevant columns
uber_df_clean = uber_df_clean.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0', 'key'], errors='ignore')

# Output cleaned dataset
print("Cleaned dataset shape:", uber_df_clean.shape)
uber_df_clean.head()
```

![Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f041c7cf-73be-4243-912a-5fb87de5c264)

**Why this?**

This cleans and prepares a raw Uber dataset for analysis. It filters out invalid and irrelevant data, such as trips with incorrect fares or coordinates outside of New York City. It then enriches the data by creating new features like the time of day and day of the week. Finally, it visualizes the cleaned data to reveal patterns and relationships, and saves the enhanced dataset for further use.

### Now you can save the file as uber_fares_enhanced.csv.
```python
# Save the enhanced dataset
uber_df_encoded.to_csv('uber_fares_enhanced.csv', index=False)

print("Successfully saved the enhanced dataset to 'uber_fares_enhanced.csv'")
```

### 3. 🌟 Feature Engineering
The analysis reveals a strong correlation between fare amounts and trip distances, with most rides concentrated in Manhattan and fares typically under $20. Evening hours exhibit greater fare variability, hinting at surge pricing dynamics.

- **Output**: Exported enriched dataset as `uber_fares_enhanced.csv`.

#### a. Fare and Distance Distribution
- **🔍 Insight**: Most rides are short, with fares under $20, but outliers suggest surge pricing or long-distance trips.  
- **💡 Impact**: Highlights Uber’s focus on short trips, guiding pricing strategies and anomaly detection.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.boxplot(y=uber_df_cleaned['fare_amount'])
plt.title('Boxplot of Fare Amount')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.boxplot(y=uber_df_cleaned['distance'])
plt.title('Boxplot of Distance')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
- **Output**:

#### b. Fare Range Analysis ($0–$100)
- **🔍 Insight**: Fares predominantly fall in the $5–$10 range, with frequency decreasing as fares rise.  
- **💡 Impact**: Reinforces Uber’s appeal for affordable rides, informing promotional strategies.
```python
# Filter out extreme outliers for a more informative visualization
reasonable_fares = uber_df_cleaned[(uber_df_cleaned['fare_amount'] > 0) & (uber_df_cleaned['fare_amount'] <= 100)]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(reasonable_fares['fare_amount'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Uber Fare Amounts (0 to $100)')
plt.xlabel('Fare Amount ($)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
```
- **Output**:

#### c. Distance vs. Fare & Hourly Fare Trends
- **🔍 Scatter Plot Insight**: A linear relationship confirms distance as a primary fare driver.  
- **🔍 Boxplot Insight**: Evening hours show wider fare variability, likely due to surge pricing.  
- **💡 Impact**: Validates pricing models and suggests dynamic driver allocation during peak hours.
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))

# Fare amount vs. distance
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.scatter(reasonable_fares['distance'], reasonable_fares['fare_amount'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Fare Amount vs. Distance')
plt.xlabel('Distance (km)')
plt.ylabel('Fare Amount ($)')

# Fare amount vs. hour of the day
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.boxplot(x=reasonable_fares['hour'], y=reasonable_fares['fare_amount'])
plt.title('Fare Amount vs. Hour of the Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day')
plt.ylabel('Fare Amount ($)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
- **Output**:
